== !ObjectWeb's ASM ==

An open source project by an open source consortium. 
 * [http://www.objectweb.org/ ObjectWeb's site]. 
 * [http://asm.objectweb.org/ ASM's site].
 * [http://asm.objectweb.org/download/index.html ASM's download page].

== Java 5 or higher ==

No reason why not upgrade to Java 5, really. Or 6, for that matter. 

So, download it now from [http://developers.sun.com/downloads/top.jsp here].

== Using the -javaagent flag ==

To make the magic work, you need to specifiy the `yielder.jar` in your classpath (using the `-classpath` flag) *and* specify the jar as an [http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/instrument/Instrumentation.html instrumentation agent] using the `-javaagent` flag. So, your application should load like this (supposing you only have the `yielder.jar` to load:)

{{{
java -cp lib/yielder.jar -javaagent:lib/yielder.jar com.mycompany.MyApp
}}}
